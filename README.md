# <h1> URL Shortener </h1>

<p> This is a personal project using NodeJS, EJS and NeDB </p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p> This url shortener is funcional, but to work perfect, it's necessary to change</p>
<p> the NeDB database to another, like MongoDB or MySQL, cause NeDB saves everything</p>
<p> on a file, this way, all the time that the server restart, all data is lost </p>

<h2>Observation</h2>

<p> I believe that the big secret is to a domain very short. For example, if your </p>
<p> domainin is "test.lu", the short url will looks like "test.lu/s/EIuMiMkd" </p>
